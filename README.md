# META

This repository contains Meta-Files for the MicroTope project.

Currently that's only the docker compose file, but later this will hold the kubernetes services aswell. 

## Requirements 

- the other microtope images (already build)
- docker-compose 3.3
- docker 18
- Internet connection for vromeros amq image

## Addendum

This repo will hold v. 0.1 for most of my components very (very) long. This is as I don't want to change my stuff in multiple repos that frequently. 

I've chosen to have multiple repos to play with multiple ci/cd pipelines and not to have a monorepo. This will maybe proof bad, but I want to collect some experiences and test things out.
